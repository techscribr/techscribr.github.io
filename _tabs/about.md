Hi! I’m **Sayan** — a Data Scientist who has spent the last decade turning messy data into meaningful systems, scalable pipelines, and the occasional forecasting model that behaves itself.

I’ve built everything from **supply impressions forcasting** to **keyword/audience recommendation engines** to **agentic AI tools**, wrangled **10M-impression datasets**, and even convinced **Temporal Fusion Transformers** to run nicely at production scale. Before all that, I played with **geohashes, Spark clusters**, and multilingual text models that insisted “Hinglish” isn't a typo.

My journey’s taken me through Walmart, Sahaj, and Broadcom, with pit stops involving **Kafka storms, PySpark jobs**, and deep-dive knowledge sessions because I can't resist explaining things I find cool.

I earned my Master’s at IISc Bangalore, diving deep into **Bitcoin’s stability and anonymity** — far from ML, but a great reminder that exploring different domains often leads to unexpected passions.

This blog is my cozy corner on the internet where I break down ML/DL concepts with clarity, curiosity, and a little personality. Expect math, intuition, practical takeaways, and the occasional plot twist delivered by real-world data.

If that sounds like your kind of learning vibe — welcome aboard!
